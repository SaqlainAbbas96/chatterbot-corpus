- - Why it is obligatory for a Muslim to pray?
  - The Muslim has to understand that prayer is the greatest of the pillars of Islam, and that it is the thing which distinguishes a Muslim from a kaafir. It is a great sin to neglect performing obligatory prayers.
- - Can a person who does not perform any Namaz, will go to paradise?
  - In the name of Allah, We praise Him, seek His help and ask for His forgiveness. Whoever Allah guides none can misguide, and whoever He allows to fall astray, none can guide them aright. We bear witness that there is none worthy of worship but Allah Alone, and we bear witness that Muhammad (saws) is His slave-servant and the seal of His Messengers.Allah says in Quran:"For those who believe and do righteous deeds are Gardens as hospitable homes for their (good) deeds."(Surah Sajdah,19)
- - Shoul children and old people pray?
  -

  - Cleanliness from impurities (on the body, clothes and place of prayer), performing ablution (Wudu), facing the right direction of Qiblah, covering the private parts (All of a woman is considered to be a private part except the face and palms), praying at the proper time.
- - In what condition Namaz can be forgiven?
  -  For muslim woman, it is haraam to pray both obligatory and naafil prayers during her menstruation and they are not valid if she does them. She does not have to do a particular prayer unless she was pure or became pure with enough time to perform a complete rak’ah. For muslim men, who becomes junub as the result of a wet dream or intercourse has to do ghusl, because Allaah says: “O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salaah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles.  If you are in a state of Janaaba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body)”. It means that men cannot leave their prayer in any condition, they need to make themselves clean by taking ghusl or performing Tayammum.
- - Is it compulsory to perforn Namaz right after Azan?
  - The best practice and etiquette when one hears the adhaan is to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (saws) and respond to the declaration of the adhaan by repeating every phrase, and when the adhaan is completed one offers their desired prayers.That would be closest to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (saws).The Quran says:Indeed, prayer is a duty incumbent on the faithful, to be offered at appointed hours. (4:103)
- - Is Qazah Namaz accepted by Allah?
  - Namaz is farz on its time. If you don’t say it on time you have committed a sin for which you should do taubah(repentance). If while doing taubah you say qaza namaz as well, this would be okay. However, don’t think that qaza namaz is an alternative to the normal prayer.
